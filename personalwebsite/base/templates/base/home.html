                <p>
                    I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science at CWRU with my classes focusing mostly 
                    on software engineering. I started with Java as my first language. I started out building simple games 
                    with Swing and AWT then moved onto a little bit of Android development with Kotlin in Intellij with my programming class. 
                    When I entered college I switched to Computer Science my Sophomore year after taking a data structures class and then that
                    summer I created my github account and built a bunch of sideprojects with a friend and collaborated using git. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                     Around this same time I was teaching myself new programming languages and frameworks, and adopted Python and R to familarize
                    myself with statistics and AI concepts for my Machine Learning class. I also downloaded a Linux machine to get comfortable with Unix-like
                    environments. In addition to my sideprojects on my github, I also worked on a social media hub and helped debug their login 
                    feature using Firebase JS. Overall, alot of my experience has come from self-teaching new concepts alongside the coursework
                    and working with others on adopting new frameworks and technologies.
